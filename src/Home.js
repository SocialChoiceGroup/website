            Welcome to The Cute Dog Project
          </Typography>

          <p>
            We are a student research group within the Philosophy & Religion
            Department at Northeastern University conducting a project to
            determine who in the Department has the cutest dog, a topic about
            which there has been long-standing and passionate disagreement.
            Instead of arguing until the end of time (as philosophers will do),
            three professors decided to set their differences aside and let us
            try to answer the question in a philosophically and scientifically
            rigorous way. This was the origin of the Cute Dog Project.
          </p>
          <p>
            One reputable method of settling disputes is to vote. We decided
            that a voting contest should be put in place to settle whose dog is
            cutest in the entirety of the Philosophy & Religion Department
            (students, faculty and staff) at Northeastern. Eventually, we hope
            to extend this to the entire university and beyond. However,
            answering the apparently simple question of "Who has the cutest
            dog?" actually requires answers to several other difficult
            questions, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How are democratic processes used in group decisions to resolve
              disputes?
            </li>
            <li>What would our voting procedure be?</li>
            <li>How do we define cuteness and can we even define it?</li>
            <li>
              Who would be allowed to submit photos and who would be allowed to
              vote?
            </li>
            <li>
              How does this question help us uncover answers about generalized
              social choice theories and voting procedures?
            </li>
            <li>How do we control for possible social and cultural biases?</li>
            <li>
              How do we collect and manage voting data in ways that are secure
              and respect privacy?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Thus, determining whose dog is the cutest has required us to design
            a system informed by democratic theory, social choice theory, value
            theory, critical theory, philosophy of science, and information
            ethics. It has required us to grapple with the same sorts of issues
            that arise in democratic practice and social decision-making in
            other contexts â€“ for example, selecting a presidential candidate
            from a crowded primary field or selecting applicants for admission
            to a competitive university.
          </p>
          <p>But now, it is time to launch!</p>
          <p>
            To answer our questions, and find the cutest dog, we are running our
            project in three phases. During the first phase, we collected
            submissions for the contest. We are now in the second phase and are
            collecting votes on which dogs are cuter than others. Click on the
            button below to cast your vote! We will collect votes through April
            22, after which we will begin analysis and interpretation of the
            results. We will post the results complete with description of our
            methodology and analysis.

            Thank you for your time helping us, finally, settle a philosophers'
            debate.
